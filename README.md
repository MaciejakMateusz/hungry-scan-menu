# HungryScan - Customer mobile menu microservice

Digital menu used by restaurant visitors, defined in CMS by restaurant staff. To enter this web app, generated QR code is needed which redirects and grants temporary account to restaurant customers, used to contact central REST-API.

The REST-API project: https://github.com/MaciejakMateusz/hungry-scan-core
Data fetched by this app is defined by CMS: https://github.com/MaciejakMateusz/hungry-scan-cms

## Technologies Used
- **React** - JS library
- **Redux** - enables global app state
- **Thunk** - for handling async communication with servers and additional UI/logic separation

## Functionalities:
• Onboarding - possible to choose language of the digital menu
• Displaying categories with dishes
• Displaying each dish details (variants, additions, ingredients, allergens, labels)
• RWD design, great scaling for phones, tablets and computer screens or ultra wide in extreme cases

## Project design
The design of the application was developed in collaboration with a UX/UI designer. The project is based on her designs created in Figma. A set of SVG icons and images was provided for the project.
